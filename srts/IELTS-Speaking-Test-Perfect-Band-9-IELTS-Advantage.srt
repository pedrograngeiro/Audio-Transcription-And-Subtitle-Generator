1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Let's talk about music. How often do you listen to music?

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,960
I think I listen to music mostly when I'm driving. I think it puts me in such a good

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,040
mood when I'm like out there on a drive and I play my favorite music. I'm usually into Afro

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:22,080
music a lot, hip hop and Afro and R&B. So I prefer listening to music when I'm driving

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,800
or sometimes when I'm working out, I'm at the gym, something like that.

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,120
Is music an important subject in schools in your country?

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:38,640
In schools in my country. It is because you know I'm from India so in India music and dance and

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:46,720
expressing our emotions is usually through music and dancing. So in every school they teach classical

9
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:53,440
music or they have a subject where there is something about music usually. So I think it is

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:00,000
important. Do you ever go to live concerts? Oh I've been to three concerts and three of them

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,120
are my favorite artists and it was actually on my wish list and I made it happen and it was one

12
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:13,680
of the best experiences. And in live concerts it's a lot different than you would imagine.

13
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:20,640
Just have to keep your energy straight and it's like you can't believe it's happening.

14
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,360
Now let's talk about magazines and newspapers. Do you prefer to read magazines or newspapers?

15
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,960
Definitely magazines mostly on the topics of fashion or interior design. This is what I really

16
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,680
like because I like to see creative sides all from all over the world. I like to see what people

17
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,760
are talking about, what's new and what's trending and I like to learn like I like to have knowledge

18
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,720
of things of like what is this called, what is that called because usually when you see pictures

19
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,720
you don't usually know what it's called. So when you read a magazine or when you get the knowledge

20
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,960
that's where you get to know oh this fabric is called this or this decoration is called that.

21
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,280
So I think it's very good on information. Do you think you can learn as much from a magazine

22
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,240
as a book? Definitely not because magazine is like a shorter version of what's in a book.

23
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,000
So I definitely prefer books over magazines. Do you think that you will continue to read

24
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,240
paper-based magazines in the future? I think I'm very old-fashioned like that. I need to have a

25
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,680
physical book in my hand and that's how I think it produces serotonin in my brain. Otherwise no,

26
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:36,640
digital it's very different. I like physically reading a magazine or a book. Now let's talk

27
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:44,240
about outdoor activities. Do you like being outdoors? I love being outdoors. I usually spend my time

28
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,360
planning an activity or just being out with my friends even if I'm not doing anything I must

29
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,800
stay outdoors. I'm not a very like home based person like I can't stay home much. I have to

30
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,280
keep moving all the time. Which outdoor sports do you enjoy doing? I like going out with my friends

31
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:09,280
and playing football or some kind of activity like swimming, going to the beach. This is something

32
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,880
I really really enjoy. Which outdoor activities are most popular in your country? Definitely it's

33
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:21,520
like the game of India. Everybody loves cricket. When you go out of your house you're always going

34
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:28,240
to see like some kids playing or also badminton actually. People enjoy that a lot as well.

35
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:34,720
I'd like to describe my favorite actor and actress. So my favorite actor will be Benedict

36
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:43,040
Cumberbatch and my favorite actress is Angelina Jolie and I like their movies so much. They usually

37
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,280
star in action films or mystery films and that's very similar to where I am like in my personal

38
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:57,760
life. I love mysterious stuff. I'm like always into like detective theories or mystery books

39
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,520
and stuff like that. So I always watch movies as such and their acting is on point. It's always

40
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:09,440
number one and I like Angelina Jolie also for her humanitarian work that she does throughout her

41
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:18,160
life. She's been very present with charity work and making sure that a lot of kids are fed in

42
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,480
countries which are unfortunate and I really like that about her and I also like how fierce she is

43
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,560
and when she presents herself it's very divine feminine so I really really like that and I feel

44
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,120
like she has that sort of energy where a woman can feel powerful about herself just by looking at her

45
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,440
and kind of understanding where she comes from. She doesn't really come from a very

46
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,640
mentally stable place but now at this point in her life she's a very like strong woman and she's

47
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:56,800
done it all herself and Benedict Cumberbatch I actually watched his TV show which was called

48
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:04,000
Sherlock and I am a crazy Sherlock fan. I love mystery like I said and detective stories and

49
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,880
everything and him playing that really showed me what kind of an incredible actor he is because I

50
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,840
felt like I'm watching Sherlock Holmes from the books and not an actor on screen and he's also

51
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,400
done a movie that I really love it's called Doctor Strange that's my favorite superhero from the

52
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Avengers and he has just done an amazing job in that movie. So we've been talking about a famous

53
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,760
actress and actor that you enjoy and we're going to continue to talk about movies and theater.

54
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:40,480
What are the most popular types of movies in your country? It would be to thank you for watching

59
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,960
in the description. Thanks very much and let's get back to the video. It would be action and drama

60
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:16,720
definitely something that has to do with emotional connection. It's usually fictional that I would say

61
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:25,280
and also comedy. Yeah there's a lot of comedy that goes on in the films that are coming out now

62
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,200
and from India. Do you think that going to the cinema will be as popular in the future?

63
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:39,440
I think 50-50. I'm not sure about that but it looks like people enjoy watching movies at home

64
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:49,200
and it's not as much exciting as it used to be back then and I think probably yes it would be

65
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:56,720
more digitally available at home and probably. Now let's talk about the theater. How strong

66
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:05,600
a tradition is it today in your country to go to the theater? Mostly I think in out of city

67
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:13,120
areas actually. It's mostly now as an activity that families go to with their kids just to

68
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:20,800
show a play to their kids and to introduce them to this form of culture and activity. I think

69
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:28,720
it's more of that now. Theater is not as much popularized back in India as much as

70
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,920
cinema and film and movies are so I think that is kind of on the backseat. It's not so much

71
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,360
as it used to be. Do you think that theater should be run as a business or as a public service?

72
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:50,320
I think both. I think it goes hand in hand so that people can be employed as well at the same time

73
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:58,880
and it is of a public service at the same time. I think that people do enjoy it but at the same time

74
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:10,080
it could be used as an excuse and used as like an opportunity is what I mean to employ people

75
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,200
because there's a lot of people who would love to do acting but they can't really make it in the

76
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:22,240
movies so maybe they could use theater as their hobby so I think yeah both can go hand in hand.

77
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:29,440
In some countries governments pay theaters to put on shows for the public. Do you think this is a

78
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:37,760
good use of public money? It depends on whether or not if it's free to the public because if you're

79
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,800
charging for them to see that play then it doesn't make any sense is what I think and I think that

80
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:51,120
it shouldn't be this way in the first place. I think it should be available freely to the people.

81
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:59,440
Let me give you some feedback on your performance so you're hoping to get a band nine and I'll go

92
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,400
Oh, okay. The examiner will be thinking, can I understand what this person is saying? How

93
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:06,000
clear are they? And then some higher level pronunciation features like intonation, for

94
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,800
example, I can understand 100% of what you're saying. You do have a hint of an accent, but it

95
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,920
is extremely clear listening to you. For anyone watching who has an Indian accent, they shouldn't

96
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,960
feel bad about it or anything like that. You shouldn't try and remove your accent. I think it's

97
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:29,040
about speaking as clearly as possible, but you certainly do. You also use intonation extremely

98
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,680
well. So we use intonation to convey meaning. For example, when you came in here today and I said,

99
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,760
please sit down, very flat intonation going down. Do I sound happy or rude or serious? Yeah,

100
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,800
a bit rude, a bit serious. But if I said, please sit down, my intonation is going up. Sounds completely

101
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,560
different, but the words are exactly the same. So you use intonation like that a lot to show

102
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,680
that you're excited about something, that you're happy about it, that you're serious about something

103
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:04,160
in a very, very high level way, which is very difficult to learn. And you do it very naturally.

104
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,720
You also use connected speech. So for example, if you were talking about movies,

105
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:18,480
someone learning English might say, do you want to go to the cinema? But someone at a high level,

106
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,080
like yourself, do you want to go? Want to go sounds like one word want to go because you're

107
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:30,320
connecting all the speech up, you do that a lot and very naturally. You also use sentence stress,

108
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,640
which where you emphasize certain words. That's your coffee. So you're you're emphasizing that word

109
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,440
because that's the most important word. It's very difficult to teach that it takes a long time to

110
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:49,840
learn. Wow. You're doing very well in that area. Fluency is, are you able to speak without unnatural

111
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:56,080
pauses without unnatural hesitation? And there's two reasons why people pause and

112
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:04,960
uh, that that type of thing, audible pauses like that. One one reason is they're learning a language

113
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:10,560
and they're trying to think, should I use present simple or present perfect or, you know, what's

114
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:17,600
the correct adjective to use? You don't do that. Because your your language is quite a high level.

115
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:25,520
You do sometimes pause and think and hesitate a little bit for the second reason, which is trying

116
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:32,560
to think of ideas. So you can tell especially in that part three, you were formulating ideas and you

117
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,880
were, let me think about that and pausing a little bit, but that's natural. And a good examiner knows

118
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,000
the difference between those two things. So they're not going to give you a low mark for pausing or

119
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:50,480
hesitating a little bit for thinking of the idea. Now coherence is different. It's, did you answer

120
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,200
the question and did you develop your answers a little bit more? You need to be a little bit

121
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,640
careful. For example, the first question I asked you, how often do you listen to music? And you

122
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:08,640
told me about when you listen to music. So that's slightly different. Now the examiner will base

123
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:14,800
their score on all of your answers. It's not like, Oh, she didn't, she slightly didn't answer that

124
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:21,280
question in one, in one question, give her a low score. That's not how it works. And the way that

125
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:27,440
you answered that question by saying, I listened to music in the car and I listened to it in the,

126
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,440
I think you said when I drive, you're answering the question implicitly.

127
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:41,280
By implication, I know how often you listen to it. You should try to answer each question

128
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:48,000
explicitly. How often do you every day? I don't think that this is an issue for you today.

129
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,520
But imagine you go and do the test, imagine you have a Canadian visa application. I was like,

130
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:59,120
if I don't get this, I'm gonna, I can't go on meet, you know, my family or, or, you know, or I can't

131
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,200
do whatever I want to do. There's a lot of pressure on you. So often when people are under pressure

132
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:11,840
and under stress, they mess up. Just make sure that you answer every question exactly how they

133
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:19,280
want it. The same with the cue card for part two, it said, describe your favorite actor or actress,

134
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:28,960
and you did both. So technically, an examiner would be extremely picky if they marked you down for

135
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:36,240
that. But again, I'm not criticizing you, but I'm being overly cautious because on exam day,

136
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:43,520
if you go and do the test, you might go off and talk about something related to that topic,

137
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,080
but not really answering it correctly. I think you would be fine. But we just don't want to take

138
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:54,160
any risks. Towards the end, especially the last question, part three, what the examiner is thinking

139
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,840
about is, can this person really develop their answers? Can they speak at length about topics?

140
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:05,120
The last question, there's quite a short answer for part three. But that was quite impressive.

141
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,480
I'll tell you why. If you get a really, really difficult question in part three, you should be

142
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,480
happy because the examiner thinks you're good. If the examiner thinks you're bad, they'll just throw

143
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,360
easy softball questions at you. If the examiner thinks that you're really good, they'll throw

144
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,880
more and more difficult questions to really just stretch you and test you. And that's what I was

145
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:32,960
trying to do at the end. A really good Band 8, Band 9 student, even if they get a question that they

146
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:38,080
don't know much about, they're not too sure about, they will attempt an answer. So your attempt at an

147
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,920
answer, even though it was quite short, indicates that you are at a very high level. Coherence is

148
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,280
the only area that I'm really, really concerned about. But overall, it's very, very good. I'm

149
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:54,480
focusing on the negative, but it's only because you should because otherwise, how would I know?

150
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,320
Yeah. A grammar, the examiner will be thinking, does this person have enough awareness of grammar

151
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,880
structures that they can talk about anything? Like, can they use comparatives to compare two

152
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,040
things? Can they use superlatives to talk about their favorite things and talk about the best

153
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:15,200
things? Whatever I throw at you, you're able to handle that. And they'll also then think about

154
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:21,520
how many grammar mistakes are you making? I think I only only heard one or two small slips,

155
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:27,280
I think preposition slip or an article slip. But that is comparable to a native English speaker.

156
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:32,880
If you listen to native English speakers speak for 15, 20 minutes, they'll make a little preposition

157
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,480
errors or subject verb agreement errors. That's natural. So don't need to worry about that.

158
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,560
And your vocabulary is also excellent. For example, this, you use very topic specific words and

159
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,080
idiomatic language, which is great. Only very high level students actually do that. So your final

160
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:57,040
band score would be the highest one, which is a bad night. Thank you so much. Yeah. That's amazing.

161
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:06,160
But, but, but if on test day, you didn't answer the questions in part one, you didn't really answer

162
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,280
the question in part two, and you didn't develop your answers enough. In part three, that would

163
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:19,440
drop you down a little bit, not hugely, but just be careful with that. All right. Less than 1% of

164
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:24,400
people get a bad night. Yeah. So there you go. Well done. Thank you.
